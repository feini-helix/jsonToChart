# Q&A

## How to view big svg file locally?

We can open svg file in browser such as Chrome or Safari, but we cannot scroll, so it is not ideal for big svg file.

To solve it, we can install this free tool http://gapplin.wolfrosch.com/ , and use it to view svg file, it also is very useful to convert svg into png/pdf/tiff.
